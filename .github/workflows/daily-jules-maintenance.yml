## Daily Maintenance Run — @jules

This is an automated daily maintenance task. Please complete the steps below **in order**, stopping at the first step that produces meaningful work. Do not attempt all three steps in a single PR.

---

### Step 1 — Process the intake queue

Open `docs/new-sources.md` and find all entries where `Status` is `new`.

For each entry:
1. Check `data/all_tools.json` and `docs/tools/` to see if a canonical page already exists for this tool or concept. If it does, add the source URL to `## Sources / references` on that page and mark the entry `integrated`. Move to the next entry.
2. Classify the entry using the tags in `docs/standards.md`: `tool` · `framework` · `provider` · `paper/article` · `tutorial/guide` · `benchmark/eval` · `infrastructure` · `analysis`
3. Determine the correct target directory from the taxonomy table in `docs/standards.md`.
4. Create the page using `docs/templates/tool_template.md` (for tools, frameworks, providers) or `docs/templates/article_template.md` (for papers and articles). Fill in **all required sections** with concise, neutral, technically accurate content. Do not leave any section empty.
5. If it is a tool, framework, or provider: add an entry to `data/all_tools.json` and add the page to the correct section of `mkdocs.yml` nav in alphabetical order.
6. Mark the entry as `integrated` in `docs/new-sources.md`.

If the queue is empty (no `new` entries), proceed to Step 2.

---

### Step 2 — Doc quality audit (only if Step 1 found nothing to do)

The 10 required sections for every tool doc are defined in `docs/standards.md`:
`## What it is` · `## What problem it solves` · `## Where it fits in the stack` · `## Typical use cases` · `## Strengths` · `## Limitations` · `## When to use it` · `## When not to use it` · `## Related tools / concepts` · `## Sources / references`

Find up to **3 tool docs** in `docs/tools/` that are missing one or more of these sections. For each:
- Add the missing section(s) with a one-sentence placeholder marked `<!-- needs-content -->`
- Do not change any existing content

Limit: 3 files per run.

---

### Step 3 — Broken internal links (only if Steps 1 and 2 found nothing)

Scan all Markdown files in `docs/` for internal links of the form `[text](relative-path)`. For any link where the target file does not exist at that path:
- Fix the path if the file exists at a different location
- Otherwise, remove the link anchor and leave the text inline

Limit: 10 broken links per run.

---

After completing whichever step produced changes, open a pull request titled: `chore: daily maintenance $TODAY`.
