### Model Insights
- **Google's Chain of Thought Correlation**: A study by Google found that longer reasoning chains in LLMs do not always correlate with better accuracy. In fact, there was a negative correlation (-0.54), suggesting that excessive reasoning can lead to spiraling or overthinking. This has implications for how we design and use LLMs in the future.
