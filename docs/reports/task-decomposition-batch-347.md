# Task Decomposition Report — Batch 347 (Technical Freshness Audits)

This report tracks the task decomposition and current execution status of Technical Freshness Audits for **Batch 347** on December 26, 2026.

## Audit Scope & Targets

The five oldest outstanding orchestration and pipeline documentation files in the repository have been selected for technical freshness audits and upgraded to late November/December 2026 state-of-the-art context, frontier model references, and strict schema validation standards.

| Document Path | Category | Status | Target Upgrades |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/tools/orchestration/kestra.md` | Orchestration | **Completed** | Upgraded to late 2026 standards, model references (Claude 5.1, GPT-5.5, Gemini 4.0 Pro, Llama 4, Gemma 3, Qwen 3.6), FastMCP 3.1, and flow configuration schema validation Python example with strict Pydantic v2 validation. |
| `docs/tools/orchestration/flyte.md` | Orchestration | **Completed** | Upgraded to late 2026 standards, model references (Claude 5.1, GPT-5.5, Gemini 4.0 Pro, Llama 4, Gemma 3, Qwen 3.6), FastMCP 3.1, and task execution request schema validation Python example with strict Pydantic v2 validation. |
| `docs/tools/orchestration/apache-airflow.md` | Orchestration | **Completed** | Upgraded to late 2026 standards, model references (Claude 5.1, GPT-5.5, Gemini 4.0 Pro, Llama 4, Gemma 3, Qwen 3.6), FastMCP 3.1, and DAG dynamic configuration validation Python example with strict Pydantic v2 validation. |
| `docs/tools/orchestration/apache-hamilton.md` | Orchestration | **Completed** | Upgraded to late 2026 standards, model references (Claude 5.1, GPT-5.5, Gemini 4.0 Pro, Llama 4, Gemma 3, Qwen 3.6), FastMCP 3.1, and boundary prompt input context validation Python example with strict Pydantic v2 validation. |
| `docs/tools/orchestration/zenml.md` | Orchestration | **Completed** | Upgraded to late 2026 standards, model references (Claude 5.1, GPT-5.5, Gemini 4.0 Pro, Llama 4, Gemma 3, Qwen 3.6), FastMCP 3.1, and MLStack registration schema validation Python example with strict Pydantic v2 validation. |

## Substantive Changes Summary

1. **Frontier Model References**: Added standardized, SOTA model alignments for late November/December 2026 including Claude 5.1, GPT-5.5, Gemini 4.0 Pro, Llama 4, Gemma 3, and Qwen 3.6.
2. **MCP Protocol Alignment**: Ensured references to Model Context Protocol (MCP) are aligned with late 2026 FastMCP 3.1 features/schemas.
3. **Data Verification & Contracts**: Added robust Python examples employing strict validation using **Pydantic v2** (`BaseModel`, `Field`, `ValidationError`, `model_validate`, schema validation) to satisfy knowledge contracts and maintain technical robustness.
4. **Metadata Maintenance**: Kept "Confidence" at high and updated "Last reviewed" strictly to `2026-12-26`.
