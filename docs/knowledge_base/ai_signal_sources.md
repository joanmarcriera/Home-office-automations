## Suggested Operating Cadence

- Daily: skim company release feeds for model/API/policy updates.
- Weekly: review independent analysis for implementation implications.
- Monthly: refresh canonical docs based on what changed materially.

## Curation Rules

- Prefer primary sources over reposts.
- Track only sources with clear technical signal.
- Remove sources that become mostly marketing content.
