# New Sources — Staging Inbox

This file is the daily ingestion inbox maintained by [Jules](tools/ai_knowledge/jules.md). Each entry is discovered, classified, and staged here before being integrated into canonical pages.

## How This Works

1. **Jules scans** multiple high-signal sources daily (Hacker News, Reddit, arXiv, GitHub Trending, engineering blogs, etc.)
2. **Qualifying items** are appended below with metadata and a short summary.
3. **Integration** moves items into canonical pages or marks them as duplicates.
4. Items stay here until they are either integrated or flagged as needing more info.

## Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `new` | Discovered, not yet integrated |
| `integrated` | Merged into a canonical page |
| `duplicate` | Already exists in the repo (with link to existing page) |
| `needs-more-info` | Insufficient information to create a full page |
| `low-confidence` | Source quality uncertain; do not integrate yet |

## Tags

Items are classified with one or more of:

`tool` · `framework` · `provider` · `paper/article` · `tutorial/guide` · `benchmark/eval` · `infrastructure` · `analysis`
