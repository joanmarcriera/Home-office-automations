## What it is
Google Calendar is a time-management and scheduling calendar service developed by Google. It allows users to create and edit events, set reminders, and share calendars with others.

## What problem it solves
Provides a centralized, cloud-based calendar for scheduling events, coordinating with others, and managing time across devices.

## Where it fits in the stack
