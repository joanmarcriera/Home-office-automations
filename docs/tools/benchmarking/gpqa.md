# GPQA (Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A)

GPQA is a challenging benchmark for evaluating high-level reasoning and knowledge in LLMs.

## Description
It consists of 448 multiple-choice questions written by experts (PhD-level) in biology, physics, and chemistry. The questions are designed to be "Google-proof," meaning they are difficult even for non-expert humans to solve with access to the internet.

## Key Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct answers.
- **Self-Consistency**: Metric for reasoning reliability.
