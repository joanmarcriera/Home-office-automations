# Logseq

## What it is
Logseq is a privacy-first, open-source knowledge management and collaboration platform. It uses a local-first, outliner-based approach to knowledge management, supporting both Markdown and Org-mode.

## What problem it solves
Provides a structured, privacy-respecting way to capture and organize knowledge using an outliner model, keeping all data in local plain-text files.

## Where it fits in the stack
AI & Knowledge — serves as a local-first personal knowledge management tool, complementing or serving as an alternative to Obsidian.

## Typical use cases
- Daily journaling and task management with an outliner interface
- Building a personal knowledge graph with bidirectional links
- Organizing research notes with block-level references

## Strengths
- Open-source and privacy-first with local-only storage by default
- Outliner-based editing is well suited for hierarchical note-taking
- Supports both Markdown and Org-mode formats

## Limitations
- Smaller plugin ecosystem compared to Obsidian
- Outliner paradigm may not suit users who prefer long-form writing
- Mobile experience is less polished than some competitors

## When to use it
- When you prefer an outliner-based approach to knowledge management
- When open-source and local-first data ownership are priorities

## When not to use it
- When you need a rich plugin ecosystem and extensive community themes
- When long-form document writing is the primary use case
