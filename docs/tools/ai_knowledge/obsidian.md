# Obsidian

## What it is
Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base built on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. It is highly extensible through plugins and themes, allowing you to build a personalized second brain.

## What problem it solves
Provides a flexible, local-first environment for organizing notes and knowledge using plain Markdown files, with a rich plugin ecosystem for customization.

## Where it fits in the stack
AI & Knowledge — serves as a personal knowledge management tool that stores data locally as Markdown, fitting the privacy-first philosophy of the stack.

## Typical use cases

## Strengths
