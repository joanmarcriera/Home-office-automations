# Obsidian

## What it is
Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files.

## What problem it solves
It allows you to build a "second brain" that is completely private and portable, avoiding cloud lock-in for your personal notes, research, and documentation.

## Where it fits in the pipeline
**Store / Reason (Knowledge)**

## Typical use cases (in this homelab / family automation context)
- **Homelab Documentation**: Keeping detailed logs of server configurations and network maps.
- **Family Archive**: Storing important family information, health records, and history in a permanent format.
- **Project Tracking**: Planning complex home projects using internal links and tags.

## Integration points
- **Syncthing**: Used to sync the vault across multiple devices without a cloud provider.
- **Plugins**: Extensive community plugins for Git sync, Kanban boards, and AI assistance (e.g., via Local LLMs).

## Licensing and cost
- **Open Source**: No (but the files are plain Markdown)
- **Cost**: Free for personal use
- **Free tier**: Yes
- **Self-hostable**: Yes (File-based)

## Strengths
- Extremely fast and customizable.
- Graph view helps visualize connections between ideas.
- Huge ecosystem of plugins and themes.

## Limitations
- Proprietary software (though the data is open format).
- Sync requires external tools or a paid "Obsidian Sync" service.
