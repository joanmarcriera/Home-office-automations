# GitHub Copilot CLI

## What it is
GitHub Copilot CLI is the terminal interface for Copilot-assisted development workflows.

## What problem it solves
It brings Copilot interactions into shell-driven workflows so developers and agents can request assistance without leaving the terminal.

## Where it fits in the stack
**Development & Ops Tool**. It extends Copilot from IDE-centric use into CLI-centric environments.

## Typical use cases
- Terminal-native coding assistance
- Agent workflows that call Copilot from scripts or shells
- Fast code/task prompting while staying in command-line flow

## Strengths
- Native fit for terminal-heavy engineering workflows
- Shares Copilot ecosystem and account model
- Useful for teams standardizing on GitHub-native tooling

## Limitations
- Requires GitHub/Copilot account setup and permissions
- CLI ergonomics and capabilities differ from full IDE experiences
- Network dependency for model-backed operations

## When to use it
- When teams are already invested in Copilot and want CLI usage
- When agent workflows must remain shell-first

## When not to use it
- When offline/local-only coding assistants are required
- When editor-native context and UX are the priority

## Licensing and cost
- **Open Source**: No (product feature in GitHub ecosystem)
- **Cost**: Paid Copilot plans (subject to GitHub plan terms)
- **Self-hostable**: No
