# Cursor

## What it is
An AI-powered code editor built on top of VS Code. It features a native AI chat, codebase indexing for context-aware answers, and "Composer" mode for multi-file edits.

## What problem it solves
Provides a deeply integrated AI coding experience where the editor itself understands the full codebase context, enabling more accurate completions and multi-file refactors.

## Where it fits in the stack
**Development & Ops**. Functions as a primary code editor with native AI capabilities.

## Typical use cases
- Context-aware code completion using codebase indexing
- Multi-file edits via Composer mode
- AI chat grounded in the current project

## Strengths
- Built on VS Code, so existing extensions and settings transfer easily
- Codebase indexing provides deep context for AI responses
- Composer mode supports complex, multi-file changes

## Limitations
- Proprietary; requires a subscription for full features
- Dependent on external AI providers for model inference

## When to use it
- When you want an AI-native editor with deep codebase understanding
- When performing frequent multi-file refactors or large-scale edits

## When not to use it
- When you prefer a fully open-source editor
- When you want to use only local LLMs without cloud dependencies
