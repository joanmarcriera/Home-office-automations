# GPT Engineer

## What it is
An AI tool that can build entire applications from a single prompt. It asks clarifying questions and then generates the complete codebase for a project.

## What problem it solves
Reduces the time to bootstrap a new project by generating a complete codebase from a natural language description, including asking clarifying questions to refine requirements.

## Where it fits in the stack
**Development & Ops**. Functions as an AI-driven project scaffolding and code generation tool.

## Typical use cases
- Generating a full project codebase from a prompt
- Rapid prototyping of new applications
- Exploring different architectural approaches quickly

## Strengths
- End-to-end code generation from a single prompt
- Interactive clarifying questions improve output quality
- Open source

## Limitations
- Generated code may require significant manual refinement
- Quality depends heavily on the underlying LLM

## When to use it
- When bootstrapping a new project from scratch
- When rapid prototyping is more important than production-quality code

## When not to use it
- When making incremental changes to an existing codebase
- When precise control over code structure is required
