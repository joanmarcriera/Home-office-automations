# Mentat

## What it is
An AI tool that coordinates complex changes across multiple files directly from the terminal. It uses LLMs to understand the codebase and apply edits, focusing on developer productivity and precise control.

## What problem it solves
Enables developers to make coordinated, multi-file changes from the terminal with AI assistance, reducing the manual effort of large refactors and cross-cutting edits.

## Where it fits in the stack
**Development & Ops**. Functions as a terminal-based AI coding assistant for multi-file editing.

## Typical use cases
- Coordinating complex changes across multiple files
- Codebase-wide refactoring from the terminal
- Applying precise, controlled edits with AI assistance

## Strengths
- Terminal-native workflow
- Focuses on precise control over edits
- Good for multi-file coordination

## Limitations
- Depends on external LLM providers
- Smaller community compared to alternatives like Aider

## When to use it
- When you need precise, multi-file edits from the terminal
- When codebase standardization tasks require coordinated changes

## When not to use it
- When a graphical editor experience is preferred
- When single-file completions are the primary need
