# Tabnine

## What it is
An AI code assistant that focuses on privacy and security. It offers local-only models that never leak your code, making it suitable for enterprise environments.

## What problem it solves
Provides AI code completion with strong privacy guarantees by running models locally, addressing the concern of sending proprietary code to external servers.

## Where it fits in the stack
**Development & Ops**. Functions as a privacy-focused AI code completion tool.

## Typical use cases
- AI code completion in privacy-sensitive environments
- Local-only inference on proprietary codebases
- Enterprise deployments where code must not leave the network

## Strengths
- Local-only models ensure code privacy
- Suitable for enterprise and regulated environments
- Supports multiple IDEs

## Limitations
- Local models may produce lower-quality completions than cloud-based alternatives
- Advanced features may require a paid subscription

## When to use it
- When code privacy is a hard requirement and code must not leave the local environment
- When deploying AI coding tools in enterprise or regulated settings

## When not to use it
- When completion quality is the top priority and cloud inference is acceptable
- When a free tool is preferred (consider Codeium)
