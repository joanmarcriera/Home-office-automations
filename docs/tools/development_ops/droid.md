# Factory AI Droid CLI

Droid is an AI-powered coding agent that works directly within your project to perform tasks like code reviews, security scans, and feature implementation.

## Description
Droid leverages LLMs (typically Claude) to interact with your codebase. It can be invoked via the `droid` command and supports specialized "droids" (sub-agents) for specific domains like infrastructure, security, or frontend development.
