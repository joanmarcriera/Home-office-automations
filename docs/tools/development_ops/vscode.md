# Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

## What it is
A popular open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It features a rich ecosystem of extensions, including many AI-powered tools.

## What problem it solves
Provides a lightweight yet powerful code editor with a vast extension ecosystem, serving as a foundation for AI-enhanced development workflows.

## Where it fits in the stack
**Development & Ops**. Functions as the primary code editor and extension platform for the development workflow.

## Typical use cases
- General-purpose code editing across many languages
- Hosting AI coding extensions (Copilot, Continue, Codeium)
- Remote development via SSH and containers

## Strengths
- Massive extension ecosystem
- Open source with strong community support
- Lightweight yet feature-rich

## Limitations
- Can become resource-heavy with many extensions installed
- AI features depend on third-party extensions rather than being built in

## When to use it
- When you need a versatile editor with broad language and extension support
- When you want to combine multiple AI coding tools via extensions

## When not to use it
- When you prefer an AI-native editor with built-in AI features (consider Cursor)
- When maximum editor performance is critical (consider Zed)
