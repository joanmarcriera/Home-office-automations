## What it is
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control.

## What problem it solves
It provides a versatile and highly extensible development environment for writing scripts, managing configurations, and building applications for the homelab.

**Act (Development)**

## Typical use cases (in this homelab / family automation context)
- **Configuration Management**: Editing YAML files for Home Assistant or Docker Compose manifests.
- **Scripting**: Writing Python scripts for document processing or data synchronization.
- **Infrastructure Management**: Using the terminal and extensions to manage remote servers and clusters.

## Integration points
- **GitHub**: Deeply integrated for version control and repository management.
- **Extensions**: Thousands of extensions for languages, AI assistance (Continue), and infrastructure (Remote SSH, Docker).
- **Aider**: Can be run from the integrated terminal to assist with coding.

## Licensing and cost
- **Open Source**: The code is open source (MIT); the official distribution is proprietary (but free).
- **Cost**: Free
- **Free tier**: Yes
- **Self-hostable**: Yes (via projects like code-server)

## Strengths
- Unmatched extension ecosystem.
- Extremely fast and lightweight.
- Excellent support for almost every programming language.
