# Melty

## What it is
An open-source AI code editor designed to be a "human-in-the-loop" editor that understands the intent behind your changes.

## What problem it solves
Bridges the gap between AI code generation and developer intent by focusing on understanding what the developer is trying to accomplish, rather than just generating code from prompts.

## Where it fits in the stack
**Development & Ops**. Serves as an AI-native code editor with intent-aware editing.

## Typical use cases
- Intent-driven code editing where the AI understands the purpose of changes
- Collaborative coding with AI that respects developer intent
- Open-source alternative to proprietary AI editors

## Strengths
- Open source
- Intent-aware editing approach
- Human-in-the-loop design keeps developers in control

## Limitations
- Smaller community and ecosystem compared to VS Code or Cursor
- Early-stage project; features may be limited

## When to use it
- When you want an open-source AI editor focused on understanding developer intent
- When a human-in-the-loop approach to AI-assisted editing is preferred

## When not to use it
- When you need a mature editor with a large extension ecosystem
- When you prefer a terminal-based workflow
