# Zed

## What it is
A high-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter. It is built in Rust and designed for speed, featuring native AI integration and real-time collaboration.

## What problem it solves
Addresses editor performance limitations by providing a fast, Rust-based editor with native AI and real-time collaboration built in, rather than bolted on via extensions.

## Where it fits in the stack
**Development & Ops**. Functions as a high-performance code editor with native AI and collaboration features.

## Typical use cases
- High-performance code editing where speed matters
- Real-time collaborative coding sessions
- AI-assisted development via native integrations (e.g., Anthropic)

## Strengths
- Built in Rust for high performance
- Native AI integration (not extension-based)
- Real-time multiplayer collaboration

## Limitations
- Smaller extension ecosystem compared to VS Code
- Newer editor; some features may still be maturing

## When to use it
- When editor performance and speed are top priorities
- When native AI integration and real-time collaboration are important

## When not to use it
- When you depend on VS Code extensions that are not available in Zed
- When you need a mature, widely-adopted editor ecosystem
