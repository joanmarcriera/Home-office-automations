# Anti-Gravity

## What it is
An experimental AI engineering framework that provides high-level abstractions for building autonomous agents capable of navigating and modifying complex software systems.

## What problem it solves
Simplifies the development of autonomous coding agents by offering pre-built abstractions, reducing the effort needed to build agents that can understand and refactor large codebases.

## Where it fits in the stack
**Development & Ops**. Serves as a framework for building autonomous software engineering agents.

## Typical use cases
- Building autonomous agents that navigate complex software systems
- Automated codebase refactoring via agent orchestration
- Prototyping AI-driven development workflows

## Strengths
- High-level abstractions reduce boilerplate for agent development
- Focused on autonomous navigation and modification of software systems

## Limitations
- Experimental status; not production-ready
- Limited community and documentation compared to established frameworks

## When to use it
- When building custom autonomous agents for software engineering tasks
- When exploring agent-based approaches to codebase management

## When not to use it
- When you need a stable, production-grade agent framework
- When general-purpose LLM orchestration (e.g., LangChain) is sufficient
