# Anti-Gravity (Google)

## What it is
Anti-Gravity is an agent-first development platform from Google. It provides a workspace where multiple specialized AI agents plan, code, test, and verify software automatically.

## What problem it solves
It addresses the limitations of individual chat-based assistants by coordinating a "team" of agents that can handle long-horizon tasks across different parts of a project (e.g., frontend, backend, testing) simultaneously.

## Where it fits in the pipeline
**Reason / Act (Development)**

## Typical use cases (in this homelab / family automation context)
- **Complex Feature Development**: Asking the platform to build a full-stack home dashboard from scratch.
- **Automated Verification**: Using agents to write and run an entire test suite for a home automation project.
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Managing several agents at once to refactor an entire infrastructure-as-code repo.

## Integration points
- **Google AI Ecosystem**: Deeply integrated with Google's latest Gemini models.
- **Live Browser Testing**: Built-in capabilities to launch and test applications in a browser environment automatically.

## Licensing and cost
- **Open Source**: No
- **Cost**: Free (Beta)
- **Free tier**: N/A (Currently in public beta)
- **Self-hostable**: No

## Strengths
- Coordinates multiple agents for complex, multi-layered tasks.
- Highly automated "hands-off" development experience.
- Strong verification and testing integration.

## Limitations
- Still very new and experimental.
- Proprietary platform; restricted to Google's ecosystem for now.
