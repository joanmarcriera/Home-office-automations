# Cloud Code

## What it is
A set of IDE plugins for VS Code and IntelliJ that help developers develop, deploy, and debug cloud-native applications. It provides tools for working with Kubernetes, Google Cloud, and other cloud providers directly from the IDE.

## What problem it solves
Reduces context switching by bringing cloud-native development workflows (Kubernetes management, deployment, debugging) directly into the IDE.

## Where it fits in the stack
**Development & Ops**. Bridges the gap between local development and cloud infrastructure management.

## Typical use cases
- Developing and debugging Kubernetes applications from the IDE
- Deploying applications to Google Cloud or other providers
- Setting up Kubernetes development environments

## Strengths
- Deep integration with VS Code and IntelliJ
- Native support for Kubernetes and Google Cloud workflows
- Reduces context switching between IDE and cloud consoles

## Limitations
- Primarily oriented toward Google Cloud; less useful for other providers
- Requires familiarity with Kubernetes concepts

## When to use it
- When developing cloud-native applications targeting Kubernetes or Google Cloud
- When you want to manage deployments without leaving the IDE

## When not to use it
- When working on projects that do not involve cloud infrastructure
- When a standalone Kubernetes management tool (e.g., Lens) is preferred
