# Junie CLI

## What it is
An AI coding assistant designed to live in the terminal and assist with repository-wide tasks. It provides tools for navigating code, understanding dependencies, and making changes across multiple files, focusing on being lightweight and integrated with the developer's existing terminal workflow.

## What problem it solves
Brings AI-assisted coding directly into the terminal, enabling repository-wide understanding and multi-file changes without leaving the command line.

## Where it fits in the stack
**Development & Ops**. Functions as a terminal-native AI coding assistant.

## Typical use cases
- Repository-wide code navigation and understanding
- Multi-file changes from the terminal
- Dependency analysis and exploration

## Strengths
- Lightweight, terminal-native design
- Integrates with existing terminal workflows
- Repository-wide context awareness

## Limitations
- Terminal-only interface; no GUI or IDE integration
- Smaller ecosystem compared to IDE-based assistants

## When to use it
- When you prefer a terminal-first development workflow
- When performing repository-wide tasks that span multiple files

## When not to use it
- When you prefer a graphical IDE experience
- When visual code navigation (e.g., in Cursor) is important
