# Plandex

## What it is
Plandex is an open-source, terminal-based AI coding engine designed for complex, multi-stage tasks. It breaks large tasks into manageable steps and executes them.

## What problem it solves
It tackles the "complexity wall" where standard AI assistants struggle with very large or multi-step changes, providing a persistent state and planning phase.

## Where it fits in the pipeline
**Act (Development / Agent)**

## Typical use cases (in this homelab / family automation context)
- Executing a major upgrade of the home automation stack that involves multiple breaking changes.
- Building a complex new integration from scratch that requires planning across many files.

## Integration points
- **CLI**: Primary interface.
- **LLM APIs**: Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.

## Licensing and cost
- **Open Source**: Yes (MIT)
- **Cost**: Free (Software) + LLM costs.
- **Free tier**: N/A
- **Self-hostable**: Yes

## Strengths
- Built for complexity.
- Excellent handling of state and context.
- High transparency into the AI's planning process.

## Limitations
- Higher friction for simple tasks compared to autocomplete tools.
