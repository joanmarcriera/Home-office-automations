# Plandex

## What it is
An AI-powered engine for complex, multi-file software engineering tasks. It uses a plan-based approach where it creates a plan of action and then executes it across multiple files, handling large contexts and complex dependencies.

## What problem it solves
Manages the complexity of large, multi-file changes by breaking them into explicit plans, making it easier to reason about and review AI-generated modifications across a codebase.

## Where it fits in the stack
**Development & Ops**. Serves as a plan-and-execute AI coding engine for complex, multi-file tasks.

## Typical use cases
- Large-scale, multi-file refactoring with explicit plans
- Complex feature implementation spanning many files
- Cost-optimized coding tasks via custom model routing

## Strengths
- Plan-based approach provides transparency into what the AI will do
- Handles large contexts and complex dependencies
- Open source

## Limitations
- Plan execution can be slow for very large changes
- Requires understanding of the plan-based workflow

## When to use it
- When a task spans many files and benefits from an explicit plan
- When you want visibility into the AI's intended changes before execution

## When not to use it
- When making quick, single-file edits
- When real-time inline completions are the primary need
