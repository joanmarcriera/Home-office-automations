# OpenAI Codex

## What it is
The model that powers GitHub Copilot and other AI coding tools. It is a descendant of GPT-3 that has been fine-tuned on code from GitHub.

## What problem it solves
Provides a specialized language model for code generation, enabling tools like GitHub Copilot to offer accurate code completions and generation from natural language prompts.

## Where it fits in the stack
**Development & Ops**. Functions as the underlying model powering several AI coding assistants.

## Typical use cases
- Powering code completion tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot)
- Generating code from natural language descriptions
- Translating between programming languages

## Strengths
- Fine-tuned specifically for code, yielding high-quality completions
- Broad language support inherited from GPT-3's training data
- Well-integrated into the GitHub Copilot ecosystem

## Limitations
- Proprietary; no self-hosting option
- Being superseded by newer OpenAI models (e.g., GPT-4o)

## When to use it
- When using GitHub Copilot or other tools built on Codex
- When evaluating code-specialized models against general-purpose LLMs

## When not to use it
- When you need a self-hosted or open-source code model
- When newer models (GPT-4o, Llama 3) better fit your requirements
