# OpenCode (Oh My OpenCode Ecosystem)

## What it is
OpenCode is an open coding-agent ecosystem focused on CLI-first multi-model development loops. The `oh-my-opencode` project provides an opinionated harness with workflows, commands, and integrations around that ecosystem.

## What problem it solves
It reduces setup and orchestration overhead for advanced agent-assisted coding by shipping reusable conventions, prompts, and operational defaults.

## Where it fits in the stack
**Development & Ops Tooling Ecosystem**. It acts as an agent harness layer on top of model providers and coding workflows.

## Typical use cases
- Team-standardized agent harness setup for coding tasks
- Multi-model orchestration for long-running implementation loops
- Reusable workflow commands for autonomous development sessions

## Strengths
- Open-source distribution model
- Strong focus on workflow ergonomics for agent users
- Community-driven iteration velocity

## Limitations
- Setup complexity can be high for new users
- Quality and safety depend on local configuration discipline
- Behavior can vary across model/provider combinations

## When to use it
- When you want a customizable open agent harness for terminal coding
- When you need reusable orchestration patterns across coding workflows

## When not to use it
- When your team needs a minimal, tightly-scoped assistant with limited autonomy
- When you prefer fully managed IDE-native assistants only

## Licensing and cost
- **Open Source**: Yes (`oh-my-opencode` is open source)
- **Cost**: Free software; model/API costs vary by provider
- **Self-hostable**: Yes
