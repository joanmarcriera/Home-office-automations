# Sourcegraph Cody

## What it is
An AI coding assistant that uses Sourcegraph's code graph to provide context-aware answers and completions. It understands entire codebases, including documentation and dependencies, to help write and understand code faster.

## What problem it solves
Provides AI code assistance grounded in a deep understanding of the entire codebase via Sourcegraph's code graph, yielding more accurate and contextually relevant responses than file-level tools.

## Where it fits in the stack
**Development & Ops**. Functions as a codebase-aware AI coding assistant powered by Sourcegraph's indexing.

## Typical use cases
- Context-aware code completions grounded in the full codebase
- Answering questions about code, documentation, and dependencies
- Understanding unfamiliar parts of a large codebase

## Strengths
- Leverages Sourcegraph's code graph for deep codebase understanding
- Understands documentation and dependencies, not just code
- Available as an IDE extension

## Limitations
- Full functionality may require a Sourcegraph instance
- Proprietary; enterprise pricing for advanced features

## When to use it
- When working with large codebases where deep context is critical
- When you already use Sourcegraph for code search and navigation

## When not to use it
- When a lightweight, file-level completion tool is sufficient
- When you do not want to set up or pay for Sourcegraph infrastructure
