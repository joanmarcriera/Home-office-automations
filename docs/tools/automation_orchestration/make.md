# Make (formerly Integromat)

## What it is
Make is a visual automation platform that allows you to design, build, and automate anything from tasks and workflows to apps and systems.

## What problem it solves
Enables non-developers to create complex multi-step automations connecting different apps and services through a visual drag-and-drop interface.

## Where it fits in the stack
**Orchestration**. Serves as a cloud-based automation platform, an alternative to self-hosted n8n.

## Typical use cases
- Building multi-step workflows connecting cloud services
- Automating data transformations and transfers between applications
- Creating integrations for services that lack native connections

## Strengths
- Visual scenario builder makes complex workflows accessible
- Large library of pre-built integrations
- Supports branching, error handling, and iterators natively

## Limitations
- Cloud-hosted only; no self-hosting option for privacy-first setups
- Pricing is based on operations, which can become expensive at scale
- Less flexible than code-based solutions for advanced logic

## When to use it
- When you need a no-code automation platform with a strong visual editor
- When the required integrations are available and self-hosting is not a requirement

## When not to use it
- When privacy requires self-hosted automation (use [n8n](../../services/n8n.md) instead)
- When you need full programmatic control over automation logic
