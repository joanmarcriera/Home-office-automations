# Zapier

## What it is
Zapier is a popular automation tool that connects your apps and services. It allows you to automate repetitive tasks without coding or relying on developers to build the integration.

## What problem it solves
Eliminates manual repetitive work by connecting disparate apps and services through simple trigger-action workflows ("Zaps"), without requiring programming skills.

## Where it fits in the stack
**Orchestration**. Serves as a cloud-based automation platform, an alternative to self-hosted n8n.

## Typical use cases
- Automating simple trigger-action workflows between cloud services
- Connecting apps that do not have native integrations
- Setting up notifications and data routing between services

## Strengths
- Extremely large library of app integrations (thousands of supported apps)
- Simple, intuitive interface for basic automations
- Reliable cloud infrastructure with good uptime

## Limitations
- Cloud-hosted only; no self-hosting option
- Limited complexity for multi-step or branching workflows compared to alternatives
- Pricing can escalate quickly with high task volumes

## When to use it
- When you need quick, simple automations for non-self-hostable cloud services
- When the priority is breadth of integrations over workflow complexity

## When not to use it
- When privacy requires self-hosted automation (use [n8n](../../services/n8n.md) instead)
- When you need complex, multi-step workflows with advanced logic (use [Make](make.md) or n8n)
